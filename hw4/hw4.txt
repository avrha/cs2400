Objectives: Integer arithmetic, Functions, menus.
Write a C++ program that displays the following menu of choices.
1. Find the number of digits in an integer.
2. Find the nth digit in an integer.
3. Find the sum of all digits of an integer.
4. Is the integer a palindrome?
5. Quit
Enter a choice:
For each of the choices (1, 3, 4), Read a positive integer number and call a function that
processes the menu choice (descriptions below). For option 2 read two positive
integers. If the n value is invalid, print an error message and display the menu again.
Your program should continuously display the menu until the user enters 5 to quit. Any
other choice should be ignored and display the menu again.
Required Functions (use the provided prototype and function names):
• Option 1, int getNumDigits(int number):
Return the number of digits in number.
•

Option 2, int getNthDigit(int number, int n):
Return the digit number specified by n. Right most digit is digit one.

•

Option 3, int getSumDigits(int number):
Return the total value of all the digits.

•

Option 4, bool isPalindrome(int number):
returns true if the number is a palindrome (1, 121, 1221, 134431, etc.). False
otherwise.

•

A function (int getInteger()) that returns a positive integer. This function
should loop until the user enters a positive integer.

All of the above functions must only manipulate integers. Do not use string types

or arrays in any part of this project.
